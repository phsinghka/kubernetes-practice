# Kubernetes Learning Roadmap

Welcome to my Kubernetes learning journey! This README outlines a roadmap of 30 projects designed to guide you from basic to expert level in Kubernetes. Each project builds on the previous one to help you gain hands-on experience with Kubernetes and its ecosystem.

## Roadmap Overview

### **1. Introduction to Kubernetes**
- **Project 1**: Overview of Kubernetes architecture and components. Create a simple Kubernetes cluster using Minikube.

### **2. Kops for K8s Setup**
- **Project 2**: Set up a Kubernetes cluster using Kops. Configure your cluster with basic settings and deploy a test application.

### **3. Kubernetes Objects and Documentation**
- **Project 3**: Learn about Kubernetes objects (Pods, Services, Deployments, etc.). Write basic YAML manifests for each object.

### **4. Kube Config**
- **Project 4**: Configure `kubectl` with multiple contexts. Switch between different clusters and namespaces using `kubeconfig`.

### **5. Namespaces**
- **Project 5**: Create and manage namespaces. Deploy applications in different namespaces and demonstrate isolation.

### **6. Pods**
- **Project 6**: Deploy a simple pod. Understand pod lifecycle and use `kubectl` commands to inspect and manage pods.

### **7. Different Levels of Logging**
- **Project 7**: Implement logging for pods using `kubectl logs`. Explore different logging levels and integrate a logging solution like Fluentd or ELK Stack.

### **8. Services**
- **Project 8**: Create and expose a service for your pod. Understand ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer services.

### **9. Replica Sets**
- **Project 9**: Deploy a ReplicaSet to ensure a specified number of pod replicas are running. Scale the ReplicaSet and observe changes.

### **10. Deployments**
- **Project 10**: Use a Deployment to manage ReplicaSets and rolling updates. Implement blue-green or canary deployments.

### **11. Command and Arguments**
- **Project 11**: Configure container commands and arguments in a Pod spec. Understand how they override default entrypoints.

### **12. Volumes**
- **Project 12**: Implement different volume types (emptyDir, hostPath, persistentVolume). Demonstrate how data persists across pod restarts.

### **13. Config Maps**
- **Project 13**: Create and use ConfigMaps to provide configuration data to your pods. Demonstrate updating ConfigMaps and how they reflect in running pods.

### **14. Secrets**
- **Project 14**: Store and use Secrets in your Kubernetes cluster. Explore different methods of consuming Secrets in your applications.

### **15. Ingress**
- **Project 15**: Set up an Ingress controller and configure Ingress resources to manage external access to your services.

### **16. Lens (Kubernetes IDE)**
- **Project 16**: Install and use Lens to manage your Kubernetes cluster. Explore its features for monitoring and debugging.

### **17. Application Scaling**
- **Project 17**: Implement horizontal and vertical pod autoscaling. Configure resource requests and limits for optimal performance.

### **18. Helm Charts**
- **Project 18**: Introduce Helm for managing Kubernetes applications. Create and deploy Helm charts for your applications.

### **19. CI/CD Integration**
- **Project 19**: Integrate Kubernetes with a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions). Automate the deployment of applications.

### **20. Network Policies**
- **Project 20**: Implement and test Network Policies to control the communication between pods in your cluster.

### **21. StatefulSets**
- **Project 21**: Deploy applications that require stable, unique network identifiers and persistent storage using StatefulSets.

### **22. DaemonSets**
- **Project 22**: Implement DaemonSets to ensure that a copy of a pod runs on all (or some) nodes in the cluster.

### **23. Jobs and CronJobs**
- **Project 23**: Create Jobs and CronJobs for batch processing and scheduled tasks.

### **24. Resource Quotas and Limits**
- **Project 24**: Configure resource quotas and limits to manage resource consumption within namespaces.

### **25. Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**
- **Project 25**: Create and manage custom resources using CRDs. Extend Kubernetes capabilities with custom resources.

### **26. Security Contexts and Pod Security Policies**
- **Project 26**: Implement security contexts and Pod Security Policies to enforce security constraints.

### **27. Troubleshooting and Debugging**
- **Project 27**: Learn techniques for troubleshooting and debugging Kubernetes applications and clusters.

### **28. Cluster Maintenance**
- **Project 28**: Perform cluster upgrades and manage cluster maintenance tasks.

### **29. Multi-Cluster Management**
- **Project 29**: Set up and manage multiple Kubernetes clusters. Implement federated deployments and configurations.

### **30. Kubernetes Best Practices**
- **Project 30**: Review and apply best practices for Kubernetes application design, security, and performance optimization.
